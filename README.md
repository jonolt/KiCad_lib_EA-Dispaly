# EA_Display

**Work in Progress**

Footprints and symbols of the Electronic Asssembly [LCD (DOG-Series)](https://www.lcd-module.com/produkte/dog.html) and [OLED diplays](https://www.lcd-module.com/produkte/olednew-technology.html) (with pins).

## Todo
- [ ] extra symbol for displays with same interface (will be duplicated when and renamed, when the symbo, design is final)
- [ ] extra symbols for Displays with background light (using the now NC pins)
- [ ] do a pin type checked with controller datasheet
- [ ] 3D shapes (scripted)
- [ ] complete symbol and footprint descriptions
- [ ] when done, push to official lib repositories

## Questions (to myself)

- Anode and Cathode connections on same or extra unit (i prefer the later)?
- OLEDs in extra library?
- What Reference name for OLED displays?
- What type are the V0-V4 pins the datasheet says power, but input or output, maybe passive would be best?
- What type have the capacitor pins to be? (I'm using passive atm)

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk, it is highly recommended to check symmbol and footprint against datasheet.
